{"name":"Hellogitworld","tagline":"Hello Git World sample training repository","body":"This is a sample project students can use during Matthew's Git class.\r\n\r\nHere is an addition by me\r\n\r\nWe can have a bit of fun with this repo, knowing that we can always reset it to a known good state.  We can apply labels, and branch, then add new code and merge it in to the master branch.\r\n\r\nAs a quick reminder, this came from one of three locations in either SSH, Git, or HTTPS format:\r\n\r\n* git@github.com:matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git\r\n* git://github.com/matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git\r\n* https://matthewmccullough@github.com/matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git\r\n\r\nWe can, as an example effort, even modify this README and change it as if it were source code for the purposes of the class.\r\n\r\nThis demo also includes an image with changes on a branch for examination of image diff on GitHub.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
